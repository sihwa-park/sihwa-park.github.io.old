## Short Bio

I am a researcher at the [System INtelligence Group](https://singkru.github.io/) at Korea University, supervised by Prof. [Seung Jun Baek](https://singkru.github.io/). I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics and my Master of Science in Computer Science at Korea University. More details in my CV [here.](/sihwa-park-cv.pdf)

## Research Interests

My research passion revolves around using the power of deep learning algorithms to make medical images a valuable asset in improving people's lives. My master's thesis focused on the application of neural implicit functions to 2D medical images to reconstruct 3D models. I have also explored 3D construction from a different angle, drawing inspiration from NeRF to reconstruct intricate oral structures in another paper. I am interested in many emerging vision algorithms including diffusion models and eager to develop a new model to fit the unique demands of medical tasks. I am also widely interested in representation learning.
