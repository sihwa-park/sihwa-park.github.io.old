## Research Interests

> My research goal is to make people's lives better using AI.

In detail, I am interested in how to deliver AI systems or performances to people so how to interpret a specific model or explain why this model is good. I am generally interested in ExplainableAI and AdvisableAI. In datawise, I am into public transportation data or traffic data to make a model that can save people's time on vehicles. I am also generally interested in reinforcement learning. \
